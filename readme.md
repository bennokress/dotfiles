# Benno's Dotfiles

## What's this?

This repository serves as my way to help me setup and maintain my MacBooks. It takes the effort out of installing everything manually. This was forked and adjusted by following the instructions in this wonderful blog post: https://medium.com/@driesvints/getting-started-with-dotfiles-76bf046d035c

## A fresh macOS Setup

Keep in mind that this is my personal tutorial on how I like to go about a fresh install on my macOS devices. You *need to adjust the install script* using your own private repository for things like SSH keys, commercial fonts and private or work related documents and settings! You may also want to adjust some steps to your personal liking.

### Prepare old macOS Installation
1. Ensure TimeMachine is up to date in case anything goes wrong
2. Create a [Mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup#usage) to iCloud (please use the .mackup.cfg file from this repository for your first Mackup)
3. Backup all SSH keys locally or to a private repository
4. [Backup all custom fonts](https://github.com/alichtman/shallow-backup) locally or to a private repository
5. Ensure iCloud Sync is finished

### Prepare new macOS Installation
1. Clean Install of macOS (restart -> âŒ˜+R -> erase disk -> reinstall)
2. Optional: [Set Home Folder name](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201548) to begin with a capital letter

### Restore Settings and Applications
1. Clone this repo to ~/.dotfiles
2. Important: Adjust Step 4 under PREPARATION in the `install.sh` file
3. Terminal in ~/.dotfiles: `./install.sh`

### Manual Steps
* Adjust macOS System Settings
* Adjust Finder Sidebar
* Install Safari Plugins
* Deactivate Guest User
* Sort Menu Bar and Dock Icons
* From Private Repository: Follow the TODO folder to set up private stuff

### Keep the dotfiles up to date
* When installing a new app, tool or font, add it to your fork of this repo
* When configuring a new app, make sure to run `mackup backup` to save your preferences
